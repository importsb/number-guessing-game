# number-guessing-game
Short and replayable python game where the player has three total chances to guess the random generated number between 1 and 10. Invalid inputs are caught and does not remove any attempts.

This is my first Python project I made to practice the following:
- Variables
- Random Number Generation
- Loops
- Conditionals
- User input
- Error catching(try/except)

Features
- Random number generation(1-10)
- Three total attempts to guess correctly
- Feedback after each guess
- Input validation
- Game over message when all attempts are used
